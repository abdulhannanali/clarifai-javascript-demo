## Stuff you need to know and have (clickbaity line?)
Hey, know what? This demo is based on JavaScript as is apparent from the name. Cos, rest assured this is the only real dev language. Okay, now let me Clarify (You mean Clarifai? LOL!) some stuff about the demo. AKA **Clarifaing Clarifai**.

It helps if you have a **basic JavaScript understanding** of the things discussed here and have some knowledge of the front end development scenario as well. Even if you don't know thse things you should definitely peek into the code and try out the demo, there are helpful comments along the code to help you. You shouldn't give up cos you don't know some thing, that's a lame excuse my friend! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‰

#### Clarifai Credentials
There are no credentials provided with the application, so supply your own, go to [developer.clarifai.com](https://developer.clarifai.com), signup, create a new application and copy paste the **client id** and **client secret** of this application in [`keys.js`](./js/keys.js). The demo can't successfully run without the credentials even if you got all the logic ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ

return the object in the `getKeys()` with appropriate key values
and replace the placeholder values with real world values

```js
function getKeys() {
	return {
		clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Replace this value with your Clarifai Client ID
		clientSecret: "YOUR_ClIENT_SECRET" // Replace this value with your Clarifai Client Secret
	} 
}
```

You can read more about how to setup your application, get the credentials and about many possible integrations on [Clarifai's website](https://clarifai.com).

### get this repo in your system (i am talking about your computer, lol, not you ðŸ˜ˆ)

Well that's an easy one, you gotta have that [git](https://git-scm.com/download) installed and if you haven't installed it already, seriously, you need to stop being lazy and download it now from [here](https://git-scm.com/download)

After installing [git](https://git-scm.com/download), copy pasta this line in the command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdulhannanali/clarifai-javascript-demo
```

You can make changes to this demo now, start by looking into [`index.html`](index.html) file.

You can load the file in your browser by simply opening it up, but it's recommended to setup a simple http-server using node.js or any other language. It's really easy to setup and goes a long way in helping you with demos. 
You can check out the details on setting up http-server [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server). You need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed for this purpose. 

### boiler plate code

There's some boiler plate to make the demo just work but tutorial's designed in a way so you don't need to understand all of it, to complete the demo. Just focus on the important parts marked as **TODO** in `index.js` and `keys.js` files. Especially, the parts where we are making a request to  the Clarifai API and interacting with the response received from it.

### Steps to complete this demo

1. Get the credentials from Clarifai's website and paste them into `keys.js` file in appropriate places.

2. Get the tags from the Clarifai's website for the image url entered and supply it to the view logic `displayTags` to get the tags displayed. You need to access `/v1/tag` endpoint using SDK for this purpose. You can start with the code below 

```js
Clarifai.getTagsByUrl(url, function (error, response) {
	// further code here
})
```

3. Handle and display the errors correctly too. Just so you know client requests aren't always perfect and Clarifai has to tell us sometimes that our requests are bad by giving back `400 Bad Request` instead. We really need this to convey to our user properly.

**FINAL STEP**
Get the demo running somehow

**EXTRA STEP**
use the Clarifai SDK to find the major colors in an image using `/v1/color` endpoint. (View not implemented rn)

##### Callbacks or promises (ðŸ“žðŸ”™ or ðŸ‘«)

The Clarifai's SDK supports both, so feel free to use any of them. I have used Callbacks in my solutions because that's what majority of the people know from the beginning. You can also use promises which are a newer, cooler and better way to manage callback hell.



### Libraries and helpers used

##### [Clarifai's JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-javascript)
The most notable and important part in this demo is Clarifai's JavaScript SDK which is highly easy to use. You can check out the JavaScript's SDK repo [here](https://github.com/Clarifai/clarifai-javascript) which includes comprehensive documentation in it's README and use it in the browser as well as in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) along with any shiny tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.io), [Browserify](https://browserify.io) or that new tool that hasn't even come out yet. 

You can check out SDK's for other languages in [Clarifai's Developer Guide](https://developer.clarifai.com/guide)

Other noticeable mentions that are not related with Clarifai are 

##### [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
##### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

Note: The dependencies aren't listed in [`package.json`](package.json)
